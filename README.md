# StrawberryJam2021
Code mod to be used for the Celeste Community Strawberry Jam Collab 2021.

> **Work in progress.** *(Oh god when was the last time I've set up a repo like this -jade)*

## Setup instructions

Feel free to ask a coding team captain in the collab Discord server for help.

Developing directly on the main branch is highly discouraged.

### GUI
- Clone the StrawberryJam2021 repo into your Mods folder.
  - If necessary, the URL is: `git@github.com:StrawberryJam2021/StrawberryJam2021.git`
- You should now have a StrawberryJam2021 folder in your Mods folder.
- Open the `.sln` in VS.
  - Alternatively, use another IDE. If necessary, use the following command: `dotnet build`

### CLI
- `cd` to your `Mods` folder.
- `git clone git@github.com:StrawberryJam2021/StrawberryJam2021.git`
- Open the `.sln` in VS.
  - Alternatively, use another IDE. If necessary, use the following command: `dotnet build`


## Contribution guidelines

> **Work in progress.**

- **/WIP/** Move your assigned task from the server into an issue and either assign it yourself or have a captain assign it to you. *(How exactly are we going to handle this? -jade)*
- Create a new feature branch to work on.
- Implement the request.
- Submit a pull request to merge your feature branch into the main branch.
- Let a captain review and eventually merge it.
